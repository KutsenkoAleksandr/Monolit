# Monolith
It is RESTful web application. AngularJS and Bootstrap were applied on front-end part. Spring Boot is application server and Spring Data JPA is using as wrapper of Hibernate ORM. As the database I used MySQL and application server Apache TomCat. 

This project has two parts. One of them is public of clients company, where the goods are located, their prices and their availability. Second part is administrative, where implemented control of goods (add new, edit current, delete etc).
